    "# Natural Langauge Classifier with ICD-10 - Medical classification\n",
    "## A Think2018 Lab - Python Application in Watson Studio / DSX - JuPyter / IPython Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### LAB OVERVIEW:  \n",
    "This application was built to demonstrate IBM's Watson Natural Language Classifier (NLC).  It uses the Watson Python SDK for IBM Watson to create the classifier, list classifiers, and classify the input text.  We also make use of the freely available ICD-10 API which, given an ICD-10 code, returns a name and description.  ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO).  This lab and data set is for educational purposes only. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LAB GOALS\n",
    "- Overview of ICD-10 classification system\n",
    "- Background on IBM Natural Language Classifier (NLC) and how to leverage it in classificaiton use cases\n",
    "- Familiarity with DSX/Watson Studio as mechanism for a test bench for NLC\n",
    "\n",
    "### PRIOR WORKS:  \n",
    "With thanks, this lab leverags other code and works.  WATSON SDK: Client library to use the IBM Watson services in Python and available in pip as watson-developer-cloud  https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk from https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud ; the lab also leverages code and methods framed by  https://developer.ibm.com/code/author/stevemar/ Steve Martinelli is a Development Manager focused on delivering Cognitive Journeys that empower developers worldwide. \n",
    "\n",
    "### TRAINING DATA:  \n",
    "The data set we will be using, `ICD-10-GT-AA.csv`, which contains a subset of ICD-10 entries. ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. In short, it is a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO) that contains codes for: diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. Hospitals and insurance companies alike could save time and money by levearging Watson to properly tag the most accurate ICD-10 codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "ICD 10 is quite a big set - can take 60 minutes + time to train.  Using a smaller data set - like this one https://github.com/rustyoldrake/Harry_Potter_Sorting_Hat_Simple - e.g. 200 rows and 4 classes - can take about 10 minutes. (if you want to train and play in a shorter period, use a smaller set)\n",
    "\n",
    "ICD-10 IS NOT PART OF ANY IBM OFFERING - it is a classification of the WHO and is used for informational and educational purposes only. \n",
